Below is a structured list of the exam‐candidate examples and “hint” moments that appeared throughout the lecture transcript. In many of these segments the professor “dropped” exam‐style questions or emphasized key points whose understanding you’ll likely be tested on. I’ve noted the location/context in the transcript, the problem example (or question), and the professor’s main solution line of thinking.

────────────────────────────
1. Round Robin Scheduling Simulation

• Location in lecture:
  Right at the beginning – after the “ton of material to blast through” remark, the professor “goes over” a detailed round robin scheduling example.

• What is the example?
  – The professor describes a set of processes (P1, P2, P3, P4, etc.) where each process is given as a tuple: (arrival time, burst time). For example, P1 arrives at time 0 and needs one time unit, P2 next needs two time units, etc.
  – The scheduler runs P1 then P2; when it gets to P3, it runs it for a time quantum of three time units even though P3 needed only one unit (leaving one leftover unit), then moves on to P4 and P5. Later on, new processes (P6, P7, etc.) arrive and are added to the runnable queue.

• Exam-related cues:
  – The professor emphasizes “if I were to ask you this on the exam” (or “if I were to impose the deadline …”) especially when showing that Round Robin (RR) is “deadline unaware.”
  – He calls out the downside of RR: even short jobs (like P3) incur extra wait because the scheduler must cycle through the entire queue.
  – The key is to understand the scheduling order, the impact of fixed quanta, and context switching overheads even if we assume a “zero” cost.

• Professor’s solution/points:
  – The scheduling order is explained step by step.
  – It is highlighted that while RR is “starvation free” (because every process gets a chance eventually), it does not take into account process length or deadlines.
  – You should be able to simulate the timeline and explain why a short job might be delayed due to the cyclic nature.

2. Quantitative Analysis of Scheduling Policies

• Location in lecture:
  Soon after discussing RR, the professor shifts tone with “remember, once and for the rest of your professional or academic careers…” and later “if I start asking questions…” during a discussion about success metrics.

• What is the example?
  – The professor defines “end-to-end response time” as the time between when a process enters and when it exits the system.
  – He then challenges the class to “convince me quantitatively” by, for instance, drawing the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of response times, comparing median, mean, and tail latency between policies (e.g., round robin vs. shortest-job-first or shortest-remaining-time-first).

• Exam-related cues:
  – “If this is our success metric … how well do you think we’re doing with the scheduler?”
  – Later: “Redraw the plot. Overlay the CDF for the two policies that you’re comparing.”
  – These prompts hint that an exam question might ask you not only to simulate scheduling but also to analyze the effects on response time and other statistical measures.

• Professor’s solution/points:
  – The idea is that the choice of policy (RR vs. SJF/SRTF) will change the response time distribution.
  – Your answer should include an explanation of these statistical quantities and why a policy unaware of job lengths might perform poorly in terms of mean or tail latency.

3. Shortest Remaining Time First (SRTF) – “Trick” Question

• Location in lecture:
  After finishing the RR discussion, the professor poses a “trick question” when explaining shortest remaining time first scheduling.
  He says: “If you were to go back here … which specific process would it contend for?” while referring to processes remaining in the runnable queue.

• What is the example?
  – With processes P1 and P2 completed, the runnable queue includes P3 (with one unit remaining), P4 (six original units, three already used so three left) and P5 (eight units total). The question is: which process does SRTF choose next?
  
• Exam-related cues:
  – The professor insists on precision: “Now, when you say that on a test, I will want you to be more precise.”
  – The answer is “P3” because its remaining time is the shortest.
  
• Professor’s solution/points:
  – Even though this may seem straightforward, he emphasizes understanding the impact of a recent context switch (for example, noting that switching out of P3 was due to quantum expiration even though it was nearly finished).
  – You should be ready to simulate small-step transitions and justify the selection based on the remaining execution time.

4. Producer/Consumer Synchronization – Lock and Condition Variable Example

• Location in lecture:
  Later in the lecture, the professor shifts to synchronization and discusses the classic producer–consumer problem using a linked list insertion example and then a cue/pop code segment.

• What is the example?
  – Initially, he shows code for inserting an element into a shared linked list (a “database” example) where two threads (T1 and T2) might concurrently insert nodes.
  – The professor asks: “What’s the problem here? Do we have a database?” (i.e. a race condition with unordered accesses to the same shared variable).
  – Then he introduces the idea of adding locks to enforce a “weak” ordering.
  – Finally, he discusses a producer–consumer queue where the consumer needs to wait (using condition variables) until the producer “pushes” an element and signals.
  
• Exam-related cues:
  – “When I ask this question on a test, you would have to give those precise components that match the definition” regarding what constitutes a “database” in the context of unordered accesses.
  – In the discussion on condition variables, he emphasizes that a wait must be in a while-loop. He repeatedly asks: “Why do you need to be in the while loop? Is it because of a data race or a race condition?” even though the answer is about guarding against spurious wakeups.
  – The professor also asks you to reason about placing the “signal” in the producer code relative to the lock to guarantee a “happens-before” relationship between push and pop.
  
• Professor’s solution/points:
  – For the linked list insertion, the shared resource is the single global pointer (the list head). There are two unordered accesses: one for reading/assigning the “next” pointer and another for setting the global pointer.
  – The solution is to “wrap” the critical section with locks to prevent lost updates.
  – For the producer–consumer with condition variables, the professor details that a simple if-check is not enough (it’d lead to efficiency and safety issues like spinning or spurious wakeups) and that you need a while loop to re-check the condition after waking.
  – You are expected to know how “wait” automatically releases the lock and re-acquires it on wakeup, and how “signal” or “broadcast” interacts with these semantics.

5. Dynamic Prioritization and Resource Allocation Example

• Location in lecture:
  A bit later the professor discusses a scheduling scenario involving an “inference server” versus a “Jeep learning training job.”

• What is the example?
  – The example contrasts two types of tasks: one that mostly sleeps (the inference server; high urgency, low CPU usage) and one that uses full CPU (the training job).
  – The professor explains that a scheduler (like Linux’s CFS) should ideally lower the priority of CPU‐hungry tasks over time, while the one that sleeps should retain or increase its priority.
  – He then explains that by dynamically allocating weight (via weighted fair queuing), the system can give more resources (more time quanta) to the high-priority task.

• Exam-related cues:
  – Although it isn’t posed as an exam “problem” per se, the professor stresses that you should be able to explain the tradeoffs: round robin’s fairness versus its inability to capture deadlines and priorities.
  – An exam might ask you to contrast these policies or to outline (perhaps even in pseudo-code) how a dynamic prioritized scheduler (like CFS) works.

• Professor’s solution/points:
  – The main idea is that a process’s “weight” determines its share of CPU time.
  – You must know that simple RR scheduling is deadline unaware and that weight adjustments allow the system to preempt or delay processes with lower effective priority.

6. Ordering and “Database” of Operations in Locking

• Location in lecture:
  When the professor returns to locking and synchronization, he uses an example of two threads’ executions on a shared linked list to discuss “database” races and order enforcement.

• What is the example?
  – The professor describes how two threads might interleave operations (allocating, setting next pointers, reassigning the list head) on a linked list.
  – He then asks: “What is the shared axis? Which operations are unordered?” thereby requiring you to state the conditions for a race (what he defines as a “database” – two accesses to the same shared memory location, at least one write, with no order enforced).

• Exam-related cues:
  – The professor explicitly tells you that “if I ask you on an exam” you need to include the exact definition of the database, forcing you to state that two unordered accesses (and at least one write) to a shared resource (the linked list pointer) constitute a race.
  – You must be able to trace the interleaving and explain how adding locks reduces the possible interleavings (imposing a specific dynamic order).
  
• Professor’s solution/points:
  – Even with logs (mutexes) that impose a weak ordering, you can still have problems if the ordering is nondeterministic.
  – The solution is to introduce stronger primitives (like conditional waits) to guard against unsafe interleavings.

How to Use This List for Exam Preparation

Each bullet above was flagged when the professor noted “if I were to ask you” or emphasized that “this exact detail is very important or fundamental.” Be sure to:

– Review the round robin simulation and practice “simulating” the timeline.
– Be ready to quantify performance metrics given a scheduling policy.
– Understand the rationale for SRTF versus RR—even the trick questions regarding which process is chosen.
– Study the code examples for producer/consumer synchronization. Ensure you know why the wait must be in a while loop (to guard against spurious wakeups and race conditions) and how proper signaling creates a “happens-before” relationship.
– Be prepared to give precise definitions (e.g., what exactly constitutes a “database” condition in concurrent accesses) and to explain the ordering enforced by locks.
– Lastly, understand the dynamic prioritization example and why real systems (like Linux using CFS) adjust task priorities based on observed CPU usage and sleep behavior.

By internalizing these examples and the line of reasoning provided in the lecture, you’ll be well‐prepared for potential exam questions on these scheduling and synchronization topics.

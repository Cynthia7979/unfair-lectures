Below is a detailed list of the examples, points, and topics from the transcript that the professor highlighted—either by saying “if I were to ask you…” or by strongly emphasizing them—with notes about why they’d likely show up on the exam. For each entry I’ve included the “problem” (i.e. what you might be asked) along with the professor’s answer or explanation from lecture.

─────────────────────────────  
1. Kernel Abstractions Example

• Transcript excerpt (near “if I were to ask you… on your final exam or Exam One”):
  “…So if I were to ask you, let's say, on your final exam or exam One, right? You know, give me examples of the specific functionality in the kernel that provides these abstractions and name three examples. I will want you to come up with those three examples. Of course, one of them is networking. The other is VMM.”

• Exam Question (Problem):
  “List three examples of kernel functionality that provide fundamental abstractions such as naming, reliability, isolation, multiplexing, and protection. (For instance, name which kernel subsystems provide these features.)”
  
• Professor’s Answer (Solution):
  One valid answer is:
   – Networking (providing global addressing, routing, multiplexing, etc.)
   – Virtual Memory Management (VMM – providing isolation, abstraction of physical memory)
   – File Systems (providing naming and protection among other services)
  (Additional answers might include process management; however, the lecture explicitly mentioned networking and VMM as two of the three expected examples.)

2. Ethernet Frame (L2) Structure

• Transcript excerpt (when discussing the Ethernet header):
  “...let's assume that we're dealing with Ethernet as our L2 protocol. You're going to basically end up with an Ethernet frame header which is going to consist of 14 bytes. Six of which are going to be your source MAC, six of which are going to be your destination MAC, and two bytes basically for the type.”

• Exam Question (Problem):
  “Describe the structure of an Ethernet header. How many bytes does it have, and what fields (and their sizes) are contained in it?”

• Professor’s Answer (Solution):
  The Ethernet header is 14 bytes long:
   – Destination MAC address: 6 bytes  
   – Source MAC address: 6 bytes  
   – Type field: 2 bytes

3. OSI layers / Network Protocol Stack Mnemonic

• Transcript excerpt (while drawing the stack):
  “I’m also going to be not just me, actually… here’s the way I remember this… All people seem to need data process. And you’re going to remember it for your next 25 years. All people seem to need data processing – and this is the one that you refer to as the link layer.”
  Then he went on naming:
   – Application, Presentation, Session, Transport, Network, Datalink, and Physical  
  (Also later discussing L2, L3, and L4 details.)

• Exam Question (Problem):
  “List the OSI layers in order (or, as given by the professor’s mnemonic). How do these relate to the roles played by protocols like IP, TCP/UDP, and Ethernet?”

• Professor’s Answer (Solution):
  A typical answer:  
   1. Application  
   2. Presentation  
   3. Session  
   4. Transport (e.g., TCP/UDP)  
   5. Network (e.g., IP)  
   6. Datalink (e.g., Ethernet)  
   7. Physical  
  The professor also pointed out that many networking systems refer to just L2 (datalink), L3 (network), and L4 (transport) and that your packet is “wrapped” with headers as it goes down the stack.

4. TCP Reliability Mechanisms

• Transcript excerpt (when discussing what’s needed for a reliable stream):
  “How do we handle dropped packets? … We need numbering on your packets so you can reorder them… then you need some way to detect dropped packets … We have an acknowledgment mechanism … And then you need timeouts … the timeout mechanism also answers your question, because you can start a timer on a source and if you haven't received the acknowledgment, then you know to resend it.”

• Exam Question (Problem):
  “Explain how TCP ensures reliable, ordered delivery over an unreliable network. Specifically, describe the roles of sequence numbers, acknowledgments, and timeouts.”

• Professor’s Answer (Solution):
  TCP reliability is achieved as follows:
   – Sequence Numbers: Every segment is numbered so that the receiver can reorder out-of-order arrivals.
   – Acknowledgments: The receiver sends back acknowledgments indicating the next expected byte, which also allows multiple segments to be acknowledged cumulatively.
   – Timeouts: The sender uses timers; if an acknowledgment is not received within a calculated time (retransmission timeout), the sender retransmits the segment.
  These mechanisms work together to detect losses and compensate for potential reordering in transit.

5. Timeout Mechanism and Its Importance in Distributed Systems

• Transcript excerpt:
  “…you can’t even arrive at any consensus in a distributed system… without a timeout mechanism.”
  And later: “So it is not sufficient for us to just rely on sequencing and acknowledgments alone. We actually need a notion of time in the system and timeouts in particular. It is very important.”

• Exam Question (Problem):
  “Why are timeout mechanisms crucial in TCP (and in distributed systems in general)? Explain the role of timeouts in ensuring correct operation.”

• Professor’s Answer (Solution):
  Timeouts are used to detect when an acknowledgment is delayed or lost. They trigger retransmission so that missing data is resent; furthermore, in distributed systems, a timeout is necessary because, without it, you cannot decide when to give up waiting for a response and thus fail to reach consensus. In essence, timeouts enable the system to break deadlock situations caused by unforeseen delays or dropped packets.

6. Routing and Redundancy (ARPANET Example)

• Transcript excerpt (referring to historical design):
  “Do you know what the first successful network built ever was... It was ARPANET. … And if you only have direct point-to-point communication, then you have a single point of failure… That’s why ARPANET was designed with multiple pathways and routing protocols that would automatically fail over if one vertex (or router) failed.”

• Exam Question (Problem):
  “Discuss the importance of redundancy and routing in packet-switched networks. What role did ARPANET play in demonstrating these ideas?”

• Professor’s Answer (Solution):
  ARPANET was the first practical packet-switching network that demonstrated how multiple redundant routing paths could be used to avoid single points of failure. By designing protocols that automatically reroute around failed nodes or links, ARPANET laid the groundwork for the resilient Internet routing protocols that allow data to traverse a network of many interconnected routers.

7. Orthogonality and Composability in System Design

• Transcript excerpt (while explaining abstractions):
  “…the two fundamental properties … that have the following two properties: orthogonality and composability… Orthogonality means a small set of primitive constructs that don’t overlap in functionality, and composability means that these primitives can be combined in only a few ways—as if linking Lego or, as I say, ‘ego blocks’.”

• Exam Question (Problem):
  “Define orthogonality and composability as used in system design, particularly in the context of network protocol stacks. Why are these properties important?”

• Professor’s Answer (Solution):
  Orthogonality refers to having a relatively small and non-overlapping set of primitives (such as the fundamental headers or operations in protocols) so that each primitive does one thing well. Composability means that these primitives can be combined in limited and predictable ways to build more complex behaviors (just like easily snapping together Lego blocks). Together they ensure that the system remains manageable, flexible, and easier to analyze or extend.

8. Bonus: Scheduler Policy Design Exercise

• Transcript excerpt (mentioning bonus opportunities):
  “Another one that I’m personally excited about is that we’re giving you an opportunity to actually design a policy for the scheduler, and we want you to bid the system. We want you to bid the stock schedulers that you have to implement … and then actually prove to us that your schedule is better.”

• Exam/Assignment (Bonus) Question (Problem):
  “Design a scheduling policy for the system scheduler that meets specified performance and fairness criteria. Outline your policy and justify (mathematically or experimentally) why your design is superior compared to the stock scheduler.”

• Professor’s Hint/Solution Outline:
  This is an open-ended design question. A good answer should:
   – Clearly specify the scheduling algorithm (e.g., priority-based, round-robin, or a hybrid approach).
   – Detail how you measure or guarantee fairness and performance.
   – Provide qualitative or quantitative arguments (using system metrics or simulation results, if available) that support the claims that your policy improves on the default scheduler.
  The lecture did not give one “model” answer—it is meant to encourage creative, well-justified proposals.

─────────────────────────────  
Summary

Each of these points was interlaced in the lecture with hints that these topics are both “very important” and “exam relevant.” When reviewing for the exam, make sure you can explain and work through:
 – The details of how kernel abstractions are provided by subsystems (networking, VMM, file systems, etc.)
 – Protocol stack overhead details (for example, the Ethernet header structure and overall layering)
 – How reliable transport is achieved in TCP (using sequence numbers, acknowledgments, and timeouts)
 – General properties such as orthogonality and composability in building networks
 – Historical and operational design decisions (such as ARPANET’s approach to redundancy)
 – The bonus design challenge of proposing a scheduler policy.

Reviewing these examples and practicing writing out (or verbally explaining) both the problem and the solution will be crucial for exam success.

Happy studying!

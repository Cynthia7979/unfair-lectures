Here's a list of potential exam topics and examples based on the professor's hints and the lecture content:

1. **Entry PGDR Setup:**
   - Concept of memory aliasing using virtual frames.
   - Mapping virtual frames to physical frames.
   - Importance of understanding this mapping for exams.

2. **Page Directory Entry and Page Table Entry:**
   - Breakdown of most significant 20 bits and least significant 12 bits.
   - Essential bits like present, writable, user/super user bit.
   - Specifically mentioned that the present bit is "ultra important."

3. **Single Level vs. Two Level Paging:**
   - Trade-offs between using large page tables vs. multiple page table levels.
   - Example question potential: Evaluate overheads in different paging designs.

4. **Memory Lookups in Paging:**
   - Asked directly: "How many memory operations does it take to translate a virtual address to a physical address in a two-level page table walk?" (Answer: Two)

5. **X86-64 Paging:**
   - Complex breakdown of 64-bit address splitting.
   - Highlighted importance: Why only 48 bits are used and the division into four levels of paging.
   - Mentioned directly that understanding this is critical for exams. 

6. **TLB (Translation Lookaside Buffer):**
   - Importance of TLB in paging and efficiency.
   - Implications of single-level paging on TLB hit/miss rates.

7. **Practical Application in XV6:**
   - Understanding of code walkthrough for `walkpgdir`.
   - Directly associated with VA to PA translation.
   - Mentioned example of checking and setting the present bit.

8. **Limitations of XV6 compared to other OS:**
   - Unable to map multiple virtual pages to a single physical page.
   - Importance of copy-on-write and shared memory in other OS.

These insights suggest the professor considers understanding paging mechanisms, TLB, and practical coding examples from XV6 as key exam topics.

Below is a detailed list of the concrete examples, computations, and “if I were to ask you…” hints scattered through the lecture transcript that the Professor appears to have earmarked as potential exam questions or exam‐relevant insights. In other words, the Professor interleaves these examples with hints (sometimes explicit “if I were to ask you…” statements) so that an attentive listener can be well prepared. The key items are:

─────────────────────────────  
1. Trade‐Off Analysis of Storage Options

 • Context in Lecture:  
  – While discussing storage trends (the “cost vs. throughput” graph) and comparing devices such as tape, HDD, DRAM, CPU SRAM cache, SSDs, and even NVM.  
  – The Professor asks a question along the lines of “if I were to ask you on the exam, which is better? [For example, DirMo tape?]” and explains that “it depends” because none of these options is strictly superior without considering application requirements.  

 • What to Know for the Exam:  
  – Understand the trade-offs between cost and throughput.  
  – Be aware of the idea of a “feasible frontier” or Pareto frontier in these trade‐off spaces (for example, the ideal “maximum throughput–minimum cost” point).  
  – Be ready for conceptual (and possibly quantitative) questions comparing technologies like tape versus SSDs or DRAM in terms of their use cases, performance, and cost.

2. Inode Size and File Size Calculations in the XV6 File System

 • Concrete Exam‐Style Questions (two related examples):

  a. Direct vs. Indirect Pointer Limits  
   – The Professor asks: “if each address is actually pointing to a data block, which is size 512 bytes, what is the largest file size you can support if you don’t use the indirect?”  
   – Student answer in class: Approximately “6 kilobytes” (12 direct pointers × 512 bytes each).  
   – Follow‐up question: “What is the largest file size you can support in XV6?”  
    ◦ Here the indirect pointer comes into play. (In XV6 the indirect block contains 128 entries; 128 × 512 gives around 64 kilobytes additional file data. Thus the total file size is the sum of the direct–pointer region and the indirect–pointer region.)

  b. A “MicroS Question” on Contiguous Allocation  
   – The Professor hints: “if I were to construct a question just like question one on the midterm exam, I could give you a microS question where you only have a limited amount of space to put the blocks in, and I would give you an inode structure … with a requirement that the data blocks have to be contiguous.”
   – This question is meant to test why the inode structure uses a level of indirection to avoid contiguity problems and to reduce fragmentation (analogous to why virtual memory uses pages to avoid contiguous constraints).

 • What to Know for the Exam:  
  – Be able to compute maximum file sizes given fixed block sizes and a given number of direct pointers.  
  – Understand the role of the indirect pointer in extending the file size limit.  
  – Explain the design decision behind providing a layer of indirection (the inode data structure) rather than forcing contiguous allocation.  
  – Know how departures from contiguous allocation help with internal fragmentation and allow flexible file growth.

3. Disk Layout and Offset Computations Involving Inodes and Metadata

 • Context in Lecture:  
  – The Professor explains the on‐disk layout including the boot block, superblock, inode table, block bitmap, data blocks, and the log.  
  – An example question is posed: “The inode entries are 64 bytes long and the byte address on the disk is five times 512. Can somebody tell me why that is?” The answer is that you are skipping over the boot sector and the superblock.
  – Later he explains how to compute the offset for a particular inode (e.g., “what’s the byte offset for the root inode? It’s 2×512 plus 64×inode_number”).

 • What to Know for the Exam:  
  – Understand the organization of the disk: boot sector, then superblock, followed by inode tables, bitmaps, data blocks, and the log.  
  – Be prepared to do “forensic” computations—that is, mapping a file’s (or inode’s) logical block number to its location in the on‐disk layout.
  – Know why the fixed offset (e.g., skip the boot and super block) is used and how that factors into calculating the byte address for an inode.

─────────────────────────────  
4. Log Structure for Crash Consistency and Recovery

 • Context in Lecture:  
  – The Professor poses the question “What’s a log?” and explains that the log is central for recording changes so that on a crash the file system can be recovered consistently.  
  – He mentions that there will be two lectures devoted to “ordering, atomicity, and crash recovery” using a log‐structured file system idea and that he might even try implementing it in “two different ways” in code/lab.

 • What to Know for the Exam:  
  – Be able to describe the role of the log in ensuring crash consistency in file systems.  
  – Understand how file system changes are recorded in the log, and why the log does not keep changes indefinitely.  
  – Recognize that questions might test the conceptual role of the log (and perhaps some design trade-offs) in recovery mechanisms.

Additional Remarks Worth Noting (Even if They’re not “problem‐style” questions):

• The Professor repeatedly stresses that file systems offer isolation, naming, protection, and multiplexing. Be ready to discuss these services and give examples such as sharing a file between users (e.g., “Alice created a file and she wants to share it with Bob”) to illustrate isolation versus sharing.

• The analogy with cultural evolution (e.g., comparing library catalog systems to early Internet data organization) is offered to reinforce that everything in system design comes from first principles. Although not a “problem” per se, a deep understanding of these comparisons may be indirectly tested.

By reviewing these segments and ensuring you can recapitulate both the detailed numerical examples (like inode block size calculations) and the high-level design ideas (such as storage trade-offs and crash recovery via logging), you’ll have covered the examples that the Professor has hinted may appear on the exam.

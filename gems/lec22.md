Below is a detailed list of concrete examples, problems, and “exam‐worthy” questions that the professor walked through in the lecture. In many cases the professor “spiked” the discussion by saying things like “if I were to ask you this on the exam …” and “this is a freebie on the exam” to signal that these scenarios are not only illustrative of the concepts but could very well appear in an exam. For each example the professor both posed a conceptual “problem” and then walked through the answer. (In what follows you’ll find the “problem statement” as given in the lecture along with the professor’s answer and explanation notes.)

────────────────────────────
1. Crash and Read Consistency (Timeline Reasoning)

• Problem Statement:  
 Imagine a timeline where you have a write operation (writing data to disk), then a crash occurs, and afterward, you perform a read on the same file. The question prompted: “What do you expect to get on a read? Think about the space of possibilities, the best case and the worst case.”  
 It was highlighted that “if I were to ask you this on the exam” you should consider what happens if the right call returned or if the write never completed persistently.

• Professor’s Answer & Reasoning:  
 – Best-case scenario: The write operation succeeds so that at least some (or all) of the data that was written is visible upon recovery. (Specifically, he noted “Unable to read everything that I wrote in the right operation” might be the best case.)  
 – Worst-case scenario: The write did not persist at all (for instance, the disk never received it before the crash), or worse, you might end up with “partial” or even “garbage” data if only some blocks were written.  
 – The professor emphasized boundary-condition reasoning: one must think of every possibility between “nothing was written” and “everything is written correctly” and be able to describe that space mathematically.

2. Ordering Between Multiple File Descriptors

• Problem Statement:  
 Suppose you have two files, File A and File B, with the two file descriptors (FD1 and FD2) associated with them. Consider the case where you perform writes on both file descriptors and then a crash occurs. The question is: “What is the space of possibilities after the crash?”  
 Note that the professor said, “this could be a freebie on the exam” and emphasized that you must consider that the writes are not sequentially ordered across different descriptors if you do nothing extra.

• Professor’s Answer & Reasoning:  
 – Possibility 1: Both writes are persisted to disk in a “best case” scenario (everything is written correctly).  
 – Possibility 2: Neither file is updated (the worst case).  
 – Possibility 3: In between, you may see only one of the files persist—as in file A updated but file B not, or vice versa.  
 – He further illustrated that “data blocks mutated on FD one and FD two” can be thought of as forming a power set (all subsets of the union) representing the space of possible outcomes.  
 – The key point is that without guarantees for cross–descriptor ordering, one cannot assume that the order in which FD1’s writes and FD2’s writes become persistent is consistent; hence, even within a single process these operations may appear arbitrary when recovered.

────────────────────────────
3. Partial File Updates and Metadata Corruption

• Problem Statement:  
 A scenario was presented where you write to a file descriptor (say, writing a string “A” to a file) and then a crash occurs before the update is “fully” persisted. The professor asked: “What is it outputting?” and further, “What might happen if the metadata gets corrupted during that write?”  
 He pointed out “[this] is a version of what we discussed on the left-hand side,” referring to earlier timelines, and aiming to focus on the possibility of file metadata (e.g., inode pointer updates) being only partially updated by the time of a crash.

• Professor’s Answer & Reasoning:  
 – It is possible that the data blocks are partially updated while the filename’s inode information (metadata) may be inconsistent.  
 – For example, if only some direct pointer blocks within an inode are updated, then on recovery you might read “garbage” or incorrect file layout.  
 – The emphasis was on the fact that file operations may not be “atomic” and thus can lead to corruption if the lower-level metadata (which tells you where your data really is) is not updated in an all–or–nothing fashion.

────────────────────────────
4. Directory and File Creation (Ordering of Metadata Updates)

• Problem Statement:  
 Consider the process of first creating a directory (say X) and then creating a file (Y) inside that directory. The professor posed the question: “What happens if the directory metadata (the directory block for X, often called the DR block) is synced (or flushed) to disk after an open that creates Y, but before the inode metadata for Y is persisted?”  
 He emphasized that “if I were to ask you exactly what happens if mad (directory metadata) is synced after open,” then you should recognize a potential inconsistency.

• Professor’s Answer & Reasoning:  
 – In such a case, the directory may have an entry (a Durant) for Y, but the inode for Y might not be updated or accessible on disk.  
 – The consequence: Even though the metadata file Y was created (and space allocated), no pointer links from the directory point to the actual inode—yielding an “orphan inode” state.  
 – This could lead to inode leakage (unused / inaccessible inodes) and overall file system inconsistency, violating the fundamental abstraction of persistence and isolation for file metadata.

────────────────────────────
5. Flush Ordering and Write Sequencing

• Problem Statement:  
 The professor illustrated a scenario where multiple writes occur in sequence. For example, one might write block 47, then block 48, and then block 49. He then asked: “In what order would you expect these operations to happen on disk?”  
 This was aimed at showing that the disk may reorder writes unless you explicitly force ordering using a flush.

• Professor’s Answer & Reasoning:  
 – Without an external ordering primitive (i.e., flush), the operating system or disk driver may interleave writes arbitrarily.  
 – When a flush is issued, it “imposes a partial order” on the writes. For example, with a flush placed between the operations on blocks 47 and 48 (grouped as one vertex) and block 49 (a second vertex), you guarantee that all writes in the first vertex are persisted before block 49 is written.  
 – He even mathematically noted that if there are three writes (3! = 6 orderings possible) in one set and only one ordering for the next write, you can compute the total possibilities. This precise discussion of ordering – and its mathematical description – is something that can appear on an exam.

────────────────────────────
6. Shadowing – Atomicity via a Boolean Shadow Bit

• Problem Statement:  
 A key “exam–worthy” example: Explain how shadowing can guarantee atomic updates to file data. The scenario is as follows. You want to update a data block but cannot do in–place updates. So you create a copy of the data (the shadow copy) and update it. Then, you perform a bit flip on a “shadow bit” which indicates which copy is active.  
 The professor explicitly asked, “if I were to ask you precisely: How is shadowing achieving atomicity?” you should be able to offer this explanation.

• Professor’s Answer & Reasoning:  
 – The update procedure involves three steps:  
  1. Make a copy of the current data block (the shadow copy).  
  2. Apply the update to the shadow copy.  
  3. Atomically flip a single Boolean “shadow bit” to point to the updated (new) copy.  
 – The key insight is that the Boolean operation (flip) is itself atomic – the bit can only be in one of two states (0 or 1); there is no “in between” state.  
 – Therefore, even if a crash occurs during the copy or the update (but before the bit is flipped), the system still “sees” the old, consistent data because the shadow bit still points to the original copy.  
 – This design assures crash consistency (atomic semantics) at the expense of doubling the storage (since you maintain two copies) plus the overhead of additional writes and flushes.

────────────────────────────
7. Ordering Within the Shadowing Process (Intra–Operation Dependencies)

• Problem Statement:  
 Another “if I were to ask you on the exam” example was: When performing a shadow update, why must you enforce that the copy and update complete (possibly simultaneously yet logically grouped as one “vertex”) before you perform the shadow bit flip? That is, why is it not valid to have the bit flip occur simultaneously with the copy/update operations?

• Professor’s Answer & Reasoning:  
 – The flip must happen only after the copy and its subsequent update have fully completed and are flushed to disk.  
 – This ordering is enforced (typically via a flush) to ensure that when you flip the bit, the new updated data is what will be read in any recovery scenario.  
 – The professor clarified that while the copy and update to different blocks can be issued “simultaneously” (i.e. without an intermediate flush), the shadow bit flip must come afterward; otherwise, if the bit flip happens before the update is fully written, the system might point to a partially updated block.
 – This example reinforces the necessity of ordering primitives (flush) between certain vertex steps to preserve both correctness and crash consistency.

────────────────────────────
Additional Points & Hints

• Several times the professor stressed “boundary condition reasoning.” This means that when answering any exam question you can imagine the extreme cases (all or nothing) and the cases in between (partial update, garbage data, or corruption).

• The professor also underlined that “if I were to ask you …” you should be prepared to enumerate the mathematically possible outcomes (for example, the power set description for the union of updated blocks across two file descriptors, or the factorial number of orderings for write batches).

• The lecture repeatedly emphasized that while the disk interface may allow reordering and buffering (hence operations appear out-of-order), it is the job of higher-level primitives such as flush, shadowing, and logging (journaling) to provide a strong consistency guarantee. Understanding these low-level guarantees is essential for exam success.

Summary

Make sure that you:
 – Can diagram the timeline for crash–consistency scenarios and list all possible outcomes.  
 – Understand the ordering issues across file descriptors, including the non–guaranteed sequential persistency.  
 – Describe what happens during partial metadata updates (for files and directories) and how that leads to corruption or orphan inodes.  
 – Explain how flush operations impose a happens–before relationship on batched writes.  
 – Articulate the principles behind shadowing including the three–step procedure (copy, update, atomic bit flip) and the importance of the ordering (flushing before the shadow bit flip).  
 – Be prepared to answer “what if a crash happens at this precise point?” and to compute or describe the space of possible orderings.

Review these examples carefully because they are interlaced with the main lecture content but are emphasized as “exam” questions that you should be ready to solve, both conceptually and mathematically.

Below is a detailed list of examples, hints, and “if I were to ask you on the exam”–style scenarios extracted from the lecture transcript. In each bullet I identify the scenario, note the professor’s hints (for example when he emphasizes “if I were to ask you…” or “remember…”), and then summarize both the “question” that might be posed on the exam and the professor’s solution or explanation.

1. Shadowing versus Logging (The Shadow Bit Example)
 • Exam‐style prompt: “Suppose you have a file system that maintains two copies of data using shadowing. Explain how using a Boolean ‘shadow bit’ and copying/mutating the data before flipping the bit ensures atomic updates.”
 • Professor’s explanation:
  – In shadowing you keep a current copy and a shadow copy.
  – On a write, you copy the data, perform a mutation on the shadow copy, then atomically flip the shadow bit.
  – Because the shadow bit is binary (only 0 or nonzero), its atomic update prevents leaving the system in an “undefined” state.
 • Hints in lecture: The professor explained this mechanism as an overview and emphasized the binary nature of the shadow bit as “very important and fundamental” for atomicity.
 • What you need to know:
  – Understand why in-place update is not allowed.
  – Know the ordering of operations (copy, mutate, flip) and the role of flushes in ordering.

2. Reading Data in the Presence of Log Entries (Block 7 Example)
 • Exam-style prompt: “Given that block 7 has both a data block on disk and a log entry with a commit, what should the file system read? What if there is an earlier invalid (uncommitted) log entry in the prefix?”
 • Professor’s explanation:
  – If there is a valid log entry (i.e. an entry with a valid commit) and all preceding log entries are valid, you read from the log (supremacy clause).
  – However, if there is any prefix entry that is invalid (for example, its commit is missing or corrupted), then even if a later log entry has a valid commit, you must ignore the entire suffix and read from the data blocks.
 • Hints in lecture: 
  – “If I were to point you to some entry for which the commit is actually valid, but there exists an entry in the prefix of the log that’s not valid, then you would be reading from the data blocks.”
 • What you need to know:
  – The “valid prefix property” is fundamental: On encountering the first invalid log record, *all* subsequent entries are ignored.
  – Be able to explain how this invariant preserves crash consistency.

3. Reading Data When No Log Entry Exists (Block 6 Example)
 • Exam-style prompt: “If you are asked to read block six and there is no log entry for block six (but a standard data block exists on disk), from where should the data be read?”
 • Professor’s explanation:
  – You simply read from the data block on disk since no corresponding log entry exists.
 • Hints in lecture:
  – The professor presented this as a “straightforward” example.
 • What you need to know:
  – Recognize how the system distinguishes between data that has been updated in the log versus data that remains solely on disk.

4. Ordering in the Log—Flush Ordering Between Entry and Commit Pairs
 • Exam-style prompt: “Discuss the ordering guarantees in a log-based journaling system. Do we need to flush between a commit and the immediately following entry? Explain using the E_i and C_i (entry and commit) ordering scheme.”
 • Professor’s explanation:
  – The log’s append‐only nature guarantees a sequential order.
  – Within each update pair, a flush must be inserted between an entry (E_i) and its corresponding commit (C_i) to create the “happens-before” relationship.
  – The professor also explained that you do not necessarily need to flush between a commit and the subsequent entry (i.e. you can allow some out‐of-order writes between C_i and E_i+1) if the primary goal is crash consistency.
 • Hints in lecture:
  – “If I were to ask you on the exam whether E2 and C1 must be strictly ordered with an additional flush, your answer would be no, they are ordered because each E_i and C_i pair are managed with flushes.”
 • What you need to know:
  – Understand how flushes are used to impose a partial order among log records.
  – Be able to draw or explain the partial order graph with sets (E1 then flush then C1, then possibly E2 and C2, etc.).

──────────────────────────────
5. Commit Mechanism Using Checksums (Commit Mechanism #2)
 • Exam-style prompt: “Explain how overloading the commit record with a checksum works in a journal system. What happens if the checksum of an entry does not match the commit record? How does this mechanism impact the order in which log entries are processed?”
 • Professor’s explanation:
  – Instead of writing an arbitrary commit record, compute a checksum for the log entry (or group of entries in a group commit).
  – On recovery (or when reading through the log), if the checksum stored in the commit does not match what is computed for the entry, that entry is deemed invalid.
  – Due to the valid prefix property, encountering the first invalid entry invalidates all subsequent entries in the log.
 • Hints in lecture:
  – “Since we’re writing a commit to serve that purpose anyway, why not overload it and give it some semantic meaning?” and later “if you read CSA_B and it doesn't correspond to the checksum of the entry, we will consider that entry invalid.”
 • What you need to know:
  – The benefits: fewer flushes and the ability to write entries in any order while still guaranteeing atomicity.
  – How invalidation of an entry (and the suffix) preserves crash consistency.

──────────────────────────────
6. Log Merge Operation When the Log is Full
 • Exam-style prompt: “Describe what happens when the log becomes full. What is the log merge operation, and how is the log cleared afterward? Explain the pseudo-code termination condition and the rationale for atomic log clearing.”
 • Professor’s explanation:
  – When the log becomes full (since it is a fixed set of disk blocks), you perform a log merge.
  – This involves iterating over all committed entries in the log, writing each update (if valid) into the data/metadata block locations.
  – The termination condition in the pseudo-code is that if the checksum of an entry does not match (i.e. the entry is invalid), you break out of the loop.
  – After merging, to “clear” the log, you can atomically invalidate (for example, by writing garbage to or zeros over) the very first log entry. Because of the prefix property, this makes the entire log appear as empty to the recovery process.
 • Hints in lecture:
  – “What happens if we crash in the middle of a log merge?” followed by a discussion of possibilities (full merge, partial merge, no merge).
  – “The entire suffix of the log is now invalid as soon as the first invalid entry is encountered.”
  – “To clear the log, all you got to do is a single write to the very first commit record.”
 • What you need to know:
  – Be ready to explain both the merge mechanism and how atomic log clearing is achieved.
  – Understand why the merging process is idempotent (each update can be applied multiple times without changing the result).

──────────────────────────────
7. Ordering, Atomicity, and the “Happens-Before” Relationship in Journaling
 • Exam-style prompt: “Define the ‘happens-before’ relation in the context of journaling file systems and explain how it ensures atomicity between the log entry and its commit record.”
 • Professor’s explanation:
  – The relationship is a mathematical (partial order) guarantee: if commit C_i is visible, then the corresponding entry E_i must have been made visible beforehand.
  – This relationship is enforced by flushes between E_i and C_i.
  – Even if operations following the commit (for example, E_i+1) are written out-of-order relative to the commit, the ordering between E_i and C_i is maintained.
 • Hints in lecture:
  – “A happens-before relationship is not just English. It’s a mathematical construct” and “if B has been written, it implies that A is also visible.”
 • What you need to know:
  – Be prepared to describe a scenario (or even draw a diagram) showing multiple E_i and C_i pairs with flushes enforcing ordering.
  – Understand why this property is essential for ensuring that an update is either fully applied or not applied at all (atomicity).

──────────────────────────────
8. The Safety–Performance Tradeoff in Journaling Methods
 • Exam-style prompt: “Compare and contrast full journaling, write-back, and ordered logging in terms of safety and performance. Where would each of these approaches lie on the trade-off space graph?”
 • Professor’s explanation:
  – Full journaling (journal both data and metadata) provides the highest level of safety but has the worst performance.
  – Write-back (no journaling) is the fastest but offers the least safety.
  – Ordered logging (journals metadata with the guarantee that data writes precede metadata updates) strikes a balance between safety and performance.
 • Hints in lecture:
  – At the very end, the professor reviewed a slide that plotted these approaches on a safety–performance graph.
  – He mentioned, “the ordered system strikes the balance … you give up a little performance to gain most of the safety.”
 • What you need to know:
  – Be ready to explain why each approach has the properties it does.
  – Understand the practical implications (for example, for soft real-time systems, unpredictability due to log merge operations could be a dealbreaker).

Summary of How These Examples Might Appear on the Exam:
• You may be asked to solve or explain specific examples (like the block 7 read example or the ordering of E_i and C_i with flushes) with both the problem details and the principles laid out.
• The professor has stressed “if I were to ask you” certain questions, so be sure to know the answers to:
  – How to decide whether to read from the log or from disk based on validity.
  – How the atomicity of updates is enforced (via flushes, checksum validation, and the valid prefix property).
  – How to perform recovery and log merge, including the termination conditions.
  – The tradeoffs between different file system update techniques (shadowing vs. logging, full journaling vs. ordered logging vs. write-back).

Review each of these examples and ensure that you can work through the problem, draw diagrams (if needed to illustrate flush ordering or the partial order graph), and explain the professor’s solution in your own words. This detailed list should help you isolate exam-critical content from the lecture.

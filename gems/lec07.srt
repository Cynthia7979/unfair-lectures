Here's a detailed list of potential exam examples and hints from the lecture:

1. **Page Directory Entry Setup**:
   - Mapping virtual frame numbers to physical frame numbers.
   - Consider the importance of memory aliasing and virtual memory setup.
   - **Exam Hint**: Understand how two virtual frames point to one physical frame.

2. **Page Table Entry Bits**:
   - Importance of present bit, writable bit, user/superuser bit, etc.
   - **Exam Hint**: Know which bits are crucial for certain lab tasks (lab two focus).

3. **Paging Mechanism Design**:
   - Various methods of splitting the linear address.
   - Exploring different levels of paging (two-level vs. one-level).
   - **Exam Hint**: Be able to compute page directory sizes and frame allocations.

4. **Memory Overhead & Latency**:
   - Analyze trade-offs between memory overhead and latency overhead.
   - Understand the critical path of the page table walk.

5. **X86-64 Paging**:
   - Understand the 48-bit linear address space and how it's split.
   - **Exam Hint**: Compute page table sizes for a 64-bit system.

6. **Translation Lookaside Buffer (TLB)**:
   - The effect of page directory structures on TLB hit ratio.
   - Significance of having separate instruction and data TLBs.
   - **Exam Hint**: Understand the impact of TLB size on page table lookups.

7. **Code Walkthroughs (XV6)**:
   - Detailed understanding of the `walkpgdir` function in XV6.
   - Paying attention to how virtual to physical addresses are translated.
   - **Exam Hint**: Be prepared to discuss code examples like `walkpgdir` and how they handle V to P translations.

8. **Systems Design Trade-offs**:
   - The implications of design decisions on memory and performance.
   - **Exam Hint**: Think critically about how design choices affect system behavior.

9. **Support for Copy on Write and Shared Memory**:
   - Xv6 limitations for multiple virtual to single physical mappings.
   - Importance in real-world operating systems for efficiency.
   - **Exam Hint**: Consider how copy on write and shared libraries function.

These examples and hints, specifically pointed out by the professor, are crucial for understanding potential exam topics and system design principles.

Below is a detailed list of the examples and “mini‐exam questions” (together with the professor’s hints and explanations) that appeared in the lecture transcript. In several instances the professor framed a scenario, paused for student responses or said things like “if I were to ask you…” (or at least, his tone implies these examples are exam candidates). I have marked each example with the example description, the “problem statement” (as given in the lecture), and the professor’s solution or explanation notes. Review these carefully because they represent key “first‐principles” reasoning that you may be expected to reproduce on an exam.

────────────────────────────
1. Interrupts and Mutual Exclusion Deadlock Example

• Problem Setup:
 – The professor presents a piece of kernel code that writes to a shared variable while guarding it with a lock, and, on the “other side,” an interrupt handler that reads the same shared variable (and also uses locking).
 – The warm‐up question is: “What is missing here? Is this code correct?” (After students reply that the read access must be protected by a critical section.)
 – Then the professor explains that even though you have two critical sections (one in kernel code and one in the interrupt handler), a problem occurs if interrupts occur while holding the lock.

• Professor’s Explanation (Solution Highlights):
 – If an interrupt happens while the kernel code holds the lock, the interrupt handler will try to acquire the lock but then be blocked—and because the kernel code is waiting to be resumed (and cannot release its lock because the interrupt is causing a cycle), a cyclic dependency arises leading to a deadlock.
 – He emphasizes that “if you interrupt kernel code … you get deadlock” and that the way to avoid this situation is to delay (disable) interrupts when acquiring the lock.

• Exam–Ready Point:
 – Understand why locking in the kernel and interrupt handler isn’t sufficient when interrupts can occur during a critical section and how disabling interrupts circumvents this race.
 – Be prepared to explain the cycle of dependencies that leads to deadlock between the kernel critical section and the interrupt handler.

2. The “Too Much Milk” Race Condition Example

• Problem Setup:
 – The professor describes a scenario with two roommates (or partners, named Bob and Alice). The “program” is:
  • Bob checks the fridge; if it is empty, he goes to get milk, returns, and puts milk in.
  • Likewise, Alice checks the fridge, finds it empty (because the check and the update are not atomic), then goes out and buys milk.
 – The result: It is possible that both buy milk and end up with more milk than is desired.

• Professor’s Explanation (Solution Highlights):
 – He formalizes the issue in terms of two shared operations (reading the fridge and then writing an “intent” or the milk update) outside of a critical section.
 – He distinguishes between liveness (someone eventually puts milk in the fridge) and safety (at most one person buys milk).
 – The professor discusses and dismisses a “naïve note‐leaving” strategy.
 – Finally, he points out that the proper solution involves using atomic test–and–set operations (or an atomic exchange) so that the “check and update” become one indivisible operation.

• Exam–Ready Point:
 – Be ready to explain the “too much milk” problem: to state which interleavings lead to a safety violation (i.e. two purchases) and why atomicity of the check–update is required.
 – Understand how safety (“only one milk purchase”) and liveness (“milk eventually appears in the fridge”) trade off here.

3. Atomic Exchange and the Spinlock Finite State Automaton

• Problem Setup:
 – The professor introduces an atomic exchange routine as a mechanism to build a spinlock.
 – He explains the following procedure:
  ○ Initially, the lock is held (or not held). A thread continually calls the exchange operation inside a “while” loop. The atomic exchange swaps a new value (e.g. one) into the lock and returns the old value.
  ○ If the returned value is nonzero, the thread knows the lock was held and the while loop continues.
  ○ When the lock is not held (lock value equals zero), the exchange operation returns zero and the thread has acquired the lock.
 – In detail, the professor asks: “What is the exchange operation going to return if the lock is already held?” Answer: It returns one.
 – Then he goes on to build a finite state automaton that involves two binary variables—one representing the lock’s value and one (R) representing the result of the atomic exchange.

• Professor’s Explanation (Solution Highlights):
 – He enumerates the possibilities (in a two-bit state, there are four states) and identifies the “successful” state (the lock variable being one and the exchange result R being zero).
 – He explains that if state “11” persists, then the thread is spinning (the atomic exchange returns one, meaning the lock is still held by someone else).
 – The discussion includes a question for the students: “Can you enumerate all possible states (and state transitions) for this automaton?” – highlighting that this is a thinking exercise that could be tested.

• Exam–Ready Point:
 – Be prepared to (a) describe how the atomic exchange works in obtaining the spinlock and (b) enumerate and discuss the finite state automaton for the spinlock situation.
 – Understand why the only “success” state is the one where the atomic exchange returns zero (implying that the thread has acquired the lock) and how the loop continues otherwise.

4. Assembly/Memory Reordering: Two Threads and Possible Outcomes

• Problem Setup:
 – The professor presents a low–level code snippet with two threads executing concurrently on one (or more) processors. The code is as follows:
  Thread 1:
   – Move an immediate value 1 into memory location X.
   – Move the *contents of Y* into register EAX.
  Thread 2:
   – Move an immediate value 1 into Y.
   – Move the *contents of X* into register EBX.
 – The initial condition is that both X and Y are 0. The exam question is: “What are the possible final values of EAX and EBX?”

• Professor’s Explanation (Solution Highlights):
 – He walks through several candidate interleavings:
  ○ One interleaving leads to (EAX, EBX) = (0,1) when T1’s first block is executed completely before T2’s block, and vice versa (yielding 1,0).
  ○ Another interleaving (where both complete their “write” instructions before the “read” instructions) results in (1,1).
  ○ A subtle interleaving that involves instruction reordering (the professor’s “mind blown” moment) shows that getting (0,0) is also possible—
   for example, if both threads’ second instructions occur before their first instructions (because there are no data flow dependencies forcing a particular order).
 – The final answer is “all of the above” (i.e. every combination among (0,0), (0,1), (1,0), and (1,1) is possible) due to reordering under the TSO (total store order) model on x86 and the lack of data-dependent ordering.
 – He also links this to the notion of DRF (data race free) programs and the fact that only stores are strongly ordered in x86.

• Exam–Ready Point:
 – Be ready to explain the possible outcomes given such an interleaving and the reasons (memory model details like TSO and reordering).
 – Understand why having no data flow dependencies allows the processor (or compiler) to reorder reads and writes, and what effect that has on the observed results of concurrent instruction execution.

Additional Notes & Professor’s Hints Mentioned in the Lecture:
 – Throughout the lecture, the professor stresses that “everything can be derived from first principles” and that many of these seemingly trivial examples (like the interrupt and spinlock examples) are “exam material.”
 – He frequently prompts with statements like “if you were to ask me this on the exam” (or in a similar tone) and “can you enumerate all possible states,” making it clear these examples are not just illustrative but also potential exam questions.
 – Moreover, he emphasizes that such analysis is fundamental to understanding concurrency, atomicity (which is a relative construct), and the necessity for proper memory ordering and synchronization in both kernel and user–space programming.

Review these examples, your understanding of the interleavings, the conditions needed for safety versus liveness, and the reasoning behind each atomic operation. They are excellent indicators of the kind of problems and logical derivations that might appear on your exam.

Below is a detailed list of the spots in the transcript where the Professor drops hints or works through examples that he “thinks” you might well see on an exam. Note that many “exam‐ready” items come interleaved with the main lecture, and the Professor explicitly asks you to think about them and even phrases questions that “if I were to ask you …” on an exam, you should be prepared. Here’s a breakdown:

1. Exam Logistics & Scope Hints
 • Early in the lecture the Professor announces that Exam One is coming (Tuesday, March 11, in Section C). He also states that all the material up to (but excluding) security—from isolation and protection, kernel organization, virtual memory management, interrupts and concurrency/scheduling, and right through to user/kernel threading—will be “up for grabs” on the exam. He explicitly mentions that the exam material will be based on the lecture content (not lab-specific details) and that you should study the lecture recordings.
  – (Location: roughly in the middle of the initial administrative remarks about labs and exam scheduling.)

2. The “Shell–Cat” Context Switch Example
 • The Professor revisits the end of the previous lecture (the “shell calling cat” example) to illustrate a concrete, “examinable” example:
  – He shows a transition from a shell in user space calling a cat command. He then steps through the process: saving the user context as the shell calls into the kernel, switching to the scheduler’s kernel stack, then later switching into the CAT process’s kernel stack before finally loading its user context.
  – At one point he asks, “How many context switches have we made?” and confirms the answer: “Four.” 
  – This is an important, concrete example that you should be able to copy down, explain, and even reproduce on paper if asked.
  – (Location: About halfway through the lecture when he says “let’s just look at this very simple example of a shell calling another process. … How many contact switches have we made? … Four.”)

3. The Assembly Code Walkthrough for the Switch Function
 • The Professor walks through the assembly implementation of the context switch routine. He shows:
  – How the two parameters (pointers to the old and new context) are loaded from the stack,
  – Which registers are saved (EBP, EBX, ESI, EDI),
  – And then specifically highlights the “magic” two instructions (lines 21 and 22) that switch the kernel stack pointers.
  – He concludes by “popping” the saved registers in reverse order.
  – Since he emphasizes the elegance and low-level nature of these operations, you should be prepared to understand and explain why these steps work and why no privileged instructions are involved.
  – (Location: Soon after introducing the switch function. The Professor reiterates, “And so let’s just look at the assembly code for the switch function.”)

4. Discussion of What Must Be Saved When a Process Sleeps
 • Right after the assembly example, the lecture covers the mechanism for saving the process – including what parts of its state must be preserved:
  – The user context (all registers that define the user’s address space state),
  – The kernel context (saved explicitly during a kernel switch),
  – And aspects like the page directory for the address space.
  – This discussion is fundamental and points to a potential exam question like “What are the components that must be saved during a context switch?” or “What information is preserved when a process goes to sleep?”
  – (Location: Immediately after discussing the switch function and before moving on to the threading design.)

5. Trade-Off Discussion: Threading versus Multiprocessing
 • The Professor explicitly states: “if I were to ask you this question” (or implies so when describing the trade-offs) about the difference between threading and multiprocessing. He emphasizes that:
  – Multiprocessing guarantees isolation (by having a separate address space) but may cost more in terms of resource usage and context–switch overhead.
  – Threading shares the address space (offering performance advantages via shared memory and faster creation/destruction) at the cost of isolation.
  – In one part he bemoans: “if I were to ask you this on the exam… think about what trade–off space is induced by these two design choices.”
  – You should be prepared to discuss the isolation–vs–performance trade–off, including those overhead elements (cache/TLB flushes, cost of saving registers, and context switch overhead).
  – (Location: Roughly in the middle of the lecture when discussing “So what is the trade off?” and later when discussing the “difference between threading and multiprocessing.”)

6. Design Space Examples: One-to–One, Many-to–One, and Hybrid Threading Models
 • The Professor goes through three design choices in handling user and kernel threads:
  a. One-to–One Mapping
   – Every user thread has a corresponding kernel thread.
   – Advantages: true parallelism on multi–core machines.
   – Disadvantages: Higher overhead, doesn’t scale well when thread counts are high.
  b. Many-to–One Mapping (User–Level Threads)
   – Multiple user threads are mapped onto a single kernel thread.
   – Advantages: Very lightweight creation and switching.
   – Disadvantages: A blocking system call (or a sleeping thread) will block all user–level threads.
  c. Hybrid Threading (User Threads over a Pool of Kernel Threads)
   – Provides a middle ground (better than pure many–to–one but with less overhead than one–to–one).
   – Discussion of the pros and cons of this model is quite explicit.
  – The Professor peppers this discussion with exam–sounding language such as “what are the advantages and disadvantages associated with…” which are clearly pointing toward possible exam questions.
  – (Location: About three–quarters into the lecture when he starts with “Here’s one way that we can actually support user space threading” and continues down through the discussion of the three mapping options.)

7. User–Space Threading and Context Switching Without Privileged Instructions
 • Near the end of the lecture the Professor underlines a “revelatory” point:
  – He explains that because the context switch mechanism (the switch function and its assembly code) does not use any privileged instructions, it is possible to implement context switching entirely in user space.
  – He goes further to say: “if I were to ask you on a test, why is it possible to do this in user space?” you should be able to explain that it’s because switching the stacks simply involves moving data between registers and memory.
  – This is a fundamental observation that connects to the idea of having a user–space threading library.
  – (Location: Toward the end of the lecture when he says, “the punch line here … switching the stacks is possible in user space. … And if I were to ask you on a test, why is it possible to do in user space? …”)

In summary, when you review these sections again, make sure you can:
 – Reproduce the shell–cat example and enumerate the four context switches.
 – Explain the purpose of each assembly instruction in the switch function.
 – List the state (user context, kernel context, etc.) that must be saved during a sleep.
 – Compare and contrast threading versus multiprocessing in terms of resource sharing, isolation, and overhead.
 – Discuss the three different thread–mapping strategies (one-to–one, many-to–one, hybrid) along with their pros and cons.
 – Explain why user–space context switching is possible (i.e. no privileged instructions are required).

Use these detailed notes as a checklist—the Professor’s hints suggest that questions on these examples could very well find their way onto the exam.

# unfair-lectures

## Manifesto
During the Fall 2025 Semester, Design of Operating Systems (CS3210) had two sections. One of the lecturers (lead lecturer) had been teaching the class for a very long time, and was primarily in charge of creating the assessments for the class.
3 Days before the final, in an email to the class, it was revealed that the lead lecturer had been dropping hints regarding upcoming exam questions to students in his section.

> how to prepare: the best way to prepare, without a doubt, is to review my lecture recordings, religiously. And please listen very actively and take notes, instead of just having it play in the background. I structure lectures in such a way that an attentive listener will extract enough questions and hints about exam interlaced with the delivery of the main content.
> 1. e.g. for each such example covered in lecture, please make sure you can solve this example yourself. Stop the recording, write the problem down on scratch paper, and derive the solution yourself. Then resume the recording to double check the answer. 
> 2. I frequently say things like : "if I were to ask you this on the exam"
> 3. I often emphasize specific things as being very important or fundamental
> 4. I introduce concrete examples (like we did in the Atomicity 1 lecture, or the VMM lecture, considering 1-level page tables, etc)
> 5. Try to follow my line of thinking: how I conceptualize thing, how I give knowledge structure. This ability to conceptualize will, hopefully, make it clear that there's not much to memorize , that everything can be reasoned and derived from first principles. 

His lectures were recorded, but it is not practical for students not in his section to binge a semester's worth of recorded hour-long lectures in such a short timeframe right before the exam. This is the problem that motivated this project.
